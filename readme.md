Arm based Datalogger running the Atmel SAM D20 MCU.


The Pinecone logger is a specialized, yet inexpensive data logger intended for sensing environmental variables. The ease of use and low cost of these datalogger systems make them ideal for mass deployment over a large area, allowing measurement of spatially-distributed data, rather than just a time-series of one point from a single logger.


The logger supports the following sensors natively:
	DHT-22 Temperature and Humidity sensor
	1 potentiometer implemented as a point dendrometer with 14 bits of precision
	multiple ports supporting sensors implementing the SDI-12 interface, which includes most Decagon brand sensors
	1 sap flow sensor implemented with a heating element and 4 thermocouples.
